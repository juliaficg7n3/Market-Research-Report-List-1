<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion and Erosion Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-intrusive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Corrosion and Erosion Monitoring System market is categorized into two main types: intrusive and non-intrusive. Intrusive methods involve physically installing sensors or probes within the material to directly measure degradation, providing real-time data on corrosion and erosion levels but potentially causing additional damage. Conversely, non-intrusive methods utilize external monitoring techniques, such as ultrasonic or electromagnetic sensors, to assess material integrity without affecting the structure. Each method offers unique advantages in terms of accuracy, accessibility, and impact on the monitored systems.</p></p>
